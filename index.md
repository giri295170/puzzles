## Puzzle 1
You have two hourglasses. Using first hourglass, you can able to meature exactly 4 minutes. Using second hourglass, you can able to meature exactly 7 minutes. Using this two hourglasses, How can you meature exactly 9 minutes?

## Puzzle 2
Pick one 5 digit number, Ex: 12345. Here 1 was located in 0 th index position, 2 was located in 1st index position and 3 was located in 2nd index position and so on.
So the question is,

Take index 0, it has having value 1, then you must need to have one zero in the 5 digit number.
Next take index 1, It has has value 2, then you must need to have two 1's in the 5 digit number.
Next index 3, 4 & 5 same step follow.
You need to form a number which satisfies all the 5 digits.
Lets take another [example: 40000](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/velli2029056/puzzles/main/puzz.png).
In this 40000 number, it satisfies 0th, 1st, 2nd and 3rd indexes. But 4th index fails, because in the number one 4 is there. If you kept 1 in the 4th index then it fails 0th and 1st indexes (40001). So you need to form a number ,it satisfies all the indexes.
What was the 5 digit number , it satisfies all the indexes?
